## How To Play

Each disk has to be on the bottom row or above another disk.

## About The Project 

This game started as a project to practice jQuery, JavaScript, CSS and HTML. It quickly became a fun opportunity to develop the logic for the computer opponent!

I plan to build on the existing logic, and introduce options for easy, medium and hard modes.
